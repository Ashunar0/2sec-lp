# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: November 26, 2025_

Thank you for using **2sec** ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Camera and Microphone

Our app requires access to your device's camera and microphone to function. We use this access solely to record 2-second video clips when you initiate them.

### Local Storage

All videos recorded with 2sec are stored locally on your device. We do not upload your videos to any cloud server. You have full control over your data and can delete it at any time within the app.

## 2. Third-Party Services

### Google AdMob

We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data—such as your advertising ID—to provide personalized ads. For more information, please refer to [Google's Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).

## 3. Data Security

Your videos are stored locally on your device, so their security depends on your device's security settings. We recommend keeping your device secure to protect your data.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
