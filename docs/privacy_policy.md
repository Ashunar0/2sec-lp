# Privacy Policy

Thank you for using 2sec ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## 1. Information We Collect and How We Use It

### Camera and Microphone
Our app requires access to your device's camera and microphone to record 2-second video clips.

### User Account & Profile
When you use social features, we collect information such as your display name, profile picture, and user ID to enable friend connections and social interactions.

### User-Generated Content (Videos)
- **Local Storage**: Videos recorded for personal use remain on your device.
- **Cloud Storage**: When you explicitly choose to share videos with friends or post to the "Seconds" feed, those videos and their metadata are uploaded to our secure cloud servers (Firebase) to enable these sharing features.

### Social Data
To provide a safe environment, we store your friends list, friend requests, and block lists.

## 2. Third-Party Services

### Firebase (Google)
We use Firebase for authentication, database management (Firestore), and cloud storage.

### Google AdMob
We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect data such as your advertising ID to provide personalized ads.

## 3. Safety and Moderation (UGC)

To maintain a safe community, we provide tools for users to report and block inappropriate content or users. We may review reported content to ensure compliance with our community standards.

## 4. Data Security & Retention

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. You can delete your shared content or your entire account at any time through the in-app settings, which will remove your data from our servers.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
